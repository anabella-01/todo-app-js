Hello! In this project, I used resources provided by the instructor to build the HTML and CSS for the application (these were not created by me, although I plan to create an updated version using React or Astro with Tailwind in the future).
I focused my attention on the logic of the exercise, component distribution, and their structure.
I applied concepts from documentation using JSDocs, DOM manipulation, localStorage and sessionStorage. 
I worked with classes and object destructuring. The goal is to reinforce the knowledge I've gained by using only Vanilla JavaScript.
